# CS211_projects
This repo contains all the projects that I did over the course of my CS 211 class, Programming Practicum

All the work in here was done during the course of the Fall '22 semester at UIC, along with being the first coding that I did with C ever, the first coding that I 
did since taking AP Comp Sci A during my junior year of high school ('20-'21). Additionally, it was also my first use of any IDE aside from the Scratch Browser 
IDE (which who can call that an IDE in the sense of how VS Code is an IDE). I ended up learning an incredible amount of information from the course and had dramatic
progress throughout, which is reflected through the coding within the projects. Yet, I still have much more to learn and am excited to continue my coding jounrey.

Project 1 & 2 are both solo-projects wherein I coded a terminal-based game, developed by Gregory Yob in 1970, called Hunt the Wumpus. Project 2
builds on project 1 with the inclusion of more complex functions and memory manipulations including using malloc'ed linked lists as opposed to arrays.
Project 3 was a parter project in which me and my partner developed code that would figure out the best first and second words to use to find the correct word in 
NY Time's online game called wordle (available at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
